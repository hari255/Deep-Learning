****** Malaria detection using CNN ******

Used Tensorflow, Keras, sci-kit learn, stats models, numpy, pandas, matlplotlib, plotly


**Data**
Data folder contains sample images we used to train the copmuter vision model.
 
To benchmark my innovative approach, I've conducted a comprehensive performance analysis against the renowned VGG16 image-detection model. The findings not only highlight the superiority of my model but also shed light on key metrics that set it apart.
