# 1.  Computer Vision - Malaria detection using Convolutional Neural Networks

I've built a robust malaria detection model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Leveraging Python libraries such as TensorFlow, PIL, and scikit-learn, I've developed a model to accurately identify parasites(Infection) in blood smear images. This model includes preprocessing with NumPy and pandas, data visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn, and efficient model training with advanced layers like Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, and Dense. Explore the intricacies of my approach, from data augmentation to early stopping, as I aim for precise diagnosis through cutting-edge image classification.

## Data Exploration

**Data set size:** 25000 samples of images which includes parasites and non-parasite cells. Below image is plotted using Python on the dataset.

<img width="460" alt="image" src="https://github.com/hari255/Neural-Networks/assets/59302293/247ea202-56a1-45a4-a959-bec0e40e9bee">

Infected cells have some form of disturbances within the cell with a dark color formation.

UnInfected cells are with the uniform color throughout the image.

To accurately identify parasites in cell images and train our model to distinguish them, we must focus on the key aspects that differentiate these categories. This involves analyzing and understanding the unique characteristics and features that set each parasite apart. By doing so, we can ensure that our model is well-equipped to recognize and classify the various types of parasites accurately.

**The mean image for both parasitized and uninfected are pretty much same because, the diffence between these two images are very small (infection is the only difference). The average image is obviously the larger part of it and how it seems most likely is the idea.**

## Data Transformation

**Converting RGB to HSV using OpenCV**

The purpose of converting RGB images to HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) using OpenCV is to facilitate more effective image processing and analysis. The HSV color space separates image intensity (brightness) from color information, which can be particularly useful for various image processing tasks. 

**Leveraging Color based Segmentation** 
In the HSV color space, it's wasy to seperate colors based on their hue. This is useful for segmenting objects in an image based on color. This property helps us identify and differentiate te infected cell images.

`Python code to convert the images to HSV using Open CV`

``` py
  import cv2

  gfx=[]   # to hold the HSV image array
  
  for i in np.arange(0, 100, 1):
  
   a = cv2.cvtColor(train_images[i], cv2.COLOR_BGR2HSV)
   
   gfx.append(a)
   
  gfx = np.array(gfx)

  viewimage = np.random.randint(1, 100, 5)
  
  fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 5, figsize = (18, 18))
  
  for t, i in zip(range(5), viewimage):
  
   Title = train_labels[i]
   
   ax[t].set_title(Title) 
   
   ax[t].imshow(gfx[i])
   
   ax[t].set_axis_off()
   
   fig.tight_layout()

```

To benchmark my innovative approach, I've conducted a comprehensive performance analysis against the renowned VGG16 image-detection model. The findings not only highlight the superiority of my model but also shed light on key metrics that set it apart.

# 2. Recommedation systems based on Amazon user's purchase history


Hey there! üöÄ Welcome to the Amazon product Recommender project! Imagine having a buddy who knows exactly what you'd like to buy online - that's what we're creating here!

**The Story:**
You know how sometimes there's just too much stuff online, and it's hard to decide what to pick? Well, our Amazon Magic Recommender is like a superhero that helps you find cool stuff you'll love! It's like having a friend who knows your favorite things.

**How it Works:**
Big companies like Amazon use special tricks to help you find the best things to buy. They use super-smart computer programs (we call them algorithms) that look at what you liked before and suggest similar awesome stuff. It's like magic for shopping!

**Our Mission:**
We're on a mission to build our own magic recommender! We're using a special set of data from Amazon, where people gave ratings to different gadgets. We're turning these ratings into a secret code so our magic recommender can learn what people like and recommend cool things to them.

So, get ready for a magical journey where we make online shopping super fun and easy! üåü‚ú® Get ready to discover some awesome stuff made just for you! üöÄüõçÔ∏è
 
# 3. Leveraging Auto ML using H2O

**What is Auto ML?**

Automated machine learning (AutoML) is the process of automating the tasks of applying machine learning to real-world problems.

AutoML, short for Automated Machine Learning, refers to the process of automating various aspects of machine learning model development and deployment.

AutoML typically automates the following aspects of the machine learning workflow:

1. Data Preprocessing
2. Feature Selection
3. hyperparameter Tuning
4. Evaluation
5. Deployment
... Uh, that's a lot.! Also, it can interpret results. :)

**In this project, we just go through the basic steps like setting up H20 in a notebook and running through a ML problem by leveraging H2O AutoML doing the work for us.**

H2O offers many solutions to the day-to-day problems that data scientists and machine learning engineers face. It saves a lot of time during pre-processing, tuning, and evaluation.
