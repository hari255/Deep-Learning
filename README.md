# 1.  Computer Vision - Malaria detection using Convolutional Neural Networks

Used Tensorflow, Keras, sci-kit learn, stats models, numpy, pandas, matlplotlib, plotly

To benchmark my innovative approach, I've conducted a comprehensive performance analysis against the renowned VGG16 image-detection model. The findings not only highlight the superiority of my model but also shed light on key metrics that set it apart.

# 2. Recommedation systems based on Amazon user's purchase history


Hey there! üöÄ Welcome to the Amazon product Recommender project! Imagine having a buddy who knows exactly what you'd like to buy online - that's what we're creating here!

**The Story:**
You know how sometimes there's just too much stuff online, and it's hard to decide what to pick? Well, our Amazon Magic Recommender is like a superhero that helps you find cool stuff you'll love! It's like having a friend who knows your favorite things.

**How it Works:**
Big companies like Amazon use special tricks to help you find the best things to buy. They use super-smart computer programs (we call them algorithms) that look at what you liked before and suggest similar awesome stuff. It's like magic for shopping!

**Our Mission:**
We're on a mission to build our own magic recommender! We're using a special set of data from Amazon, where people gave ratings to different gadgets. We're turning these ratings into a secret code so our magic recommender can learn what people like and recommend cool things to them.

So, get ready for a magical journey where we make online shopping super fun and easy! üåü‚ú® Get ready to discover some awesome stuff made just for you! üöÄüõçÔ∏è
 
# 3. Leveraging Auto ML using H2O

**What is Auto ML?**

Automated machine learning (AutoML) is the process of automating the tasks of applying machine learning to real-world problems.

AutoML, short for Automated Machine Learning, refers to the process of automating various aspects of machine learning model development and deployment.

AutoML typically automates the following aspects of the machine learning workflow:

1. Data Preprocessing
2. Feature Selection
3. hyperparameter Tuning
4. Evaluation
5. Deployment
... Uh, that's a lot.! Also, it can interpret results. :)

**In this project, we just go through the basic steps like setting up H20 in a notebook and running through a ML problem by leveraging H2O AutoML doing the work for us.**

H2O offers many solutions to the day-to-day problems that data scientists and machine learning engineers face. It saves a lot of time during pre-processing, tuning, and evaluation.
