# 1. Malaria detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (Computer Vision)

Used Tensorflow, Keras, sci-kit learn, stats models, numpy, pandas, matlplotlib, plotly


**Data**
Data folder contains sample images we used to train the copmuter vision model.
 
To benchmark my innovative approach, I've conducted a comprehensive performance analysis against the renowned VGG16 image-detection model. The findings not only highlight the superiority of my model but also shed light on key metrics that set it apart.

# Amazon Magic Recommender!

Hey there! üöÄ Welcome to our Amazon Magic Recommender project! Imagine having a buddy who knows exactly what you'd like to buy online - that's what we're creating here!

**The Story:**
You know how sometimes there's just too much stuff online, and it's hard to decide what to pick? Well, our Amazon Magic Recommender is like a superhero that helps you find cool stuff you'll love! It's like having a friend who knows your favorite things.

**How it Works:**
Big companies like Amazon use special tricks to help you find the best things to buy. They use super-smart computer programs (we call them algorithms) that look at what you liked before and suggest similar awesome stuff. It's like magic for shopping!

**Our Mission:**
We're on a mission to build our own magic recommender! We're using a special set of data from Amazon, where people gave ratings to different gadgets. We're turning these ratings into a secret code so our magic recommender can learn what people like and recommend cool things to them.

So, get ready for a magical journey where we make online shopping super fun and easy! üåü‚ú® Get ready to discover some awesome stuff made just for you! üöÄüõçÔ∏è
 



Thank you! :)
